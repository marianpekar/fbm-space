# Fractal Brownian Motion / 3D Visualisation

Here you can see 4608 icosahedrons randomly distributed in a three-dimensional space with usage of Fractal Brownian Motion Noise. And it looks quite cool :-).

*This microproject is powered by THREE.js*. In case you've never heard of this JS library, check out [threejs.org](https://threejs.org/) where you can find more about this awesome library plus a lot of way much cooler examples of usage than in this humble repository.

## What to do here?

1. Clone this repository
2. Open **index.html** (or see it [here](https://marianpekar.github.io/fbm-space))
3. Look around using the mouse, press W/Up Arrow to move forward and speed up or S/Back Arrow to slow down or eventually speed up in the backward direction
4. Explore code in **noise.js** and **scene.js**
