## Controls

1. Change properties via control panel ( üëç [https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui))
1. Look around using the **mouse**, press **W/Up Arrow** to move forward and speed up or **S/Back Arrow** to slow down or eventually speed up in the backward direction
